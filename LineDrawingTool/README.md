# Line Drawing Tool

A tool for drawing lines and calculating the line of best fit.

## Description

This tool allows you to plot points on a graph by clicking on the canvas or by entering the coordinates in a table. The application will then calculate and display the line of best fit for the points you have plotted. You can customize the appearance of the graph, export the data to a CSV file, and even see how the line of best fit changes as you add, remove, or move points.

## Future Ideas

- [ ] Allow users to draw freeform lines instead of just plotting points.
- [ ] Add more types of regression (e.g., exponential, logarithmic).
- [ ] Implement the ability to save and load different graphs.
- [ ] Add a "dark mode" to the UI.
- [ ] Improve the UI/UX for mobile devices.
