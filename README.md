sometimes they are games, sometimes they are useful tools, sometimes they are both, and sometimes they are neither. :) I hope you enjoy them!!!

## How to Add a New Game/Widget

To keep our projects organized, please follow these simple steps when adding a new creation:

1.  **Create a New Folder:** Each new game or widget should be placed in its own dedicated folder in the root directory. The folder name should be descriptive and reflect the name of the project (e.g., "Xenophile", "PixelArtEditor").

2.  **Add an `index.html`:** Every project folder must contain an `index.html` file, which will serve as the main entry point for the application.

3.  **Include a `README.md`:** It's helpful to include a `README.md` file inside your project's folder. Use it to describe what your project does, how to use it, and any future ideas you have for it.
