This is a simple web application designed to help pet owners determine if the pavement is a safe temperature for their furry friends' paws.

## Features

*   **Location-Based:** You can check the temperature by either entering a city name or by using your device's current location.
*   **Safety Indicator:** The app provides a clear, color-coded safety message to let you know if the pavement is too hot for your pet.

## How to Use

1.  **Enter a location:** Type a city name into the input field and click "Check Temperature".
2.  **Use your location:** Click the "Use My Location" button to allow the app to access your current location.
3.  **Check the results:** The app will display the estimated pavement temperatures and a safety message.

## Future Enhancements
