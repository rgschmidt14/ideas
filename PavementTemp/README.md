# üêæ Pavement Paw-tection! üêæ

This is a simple web application designed to help pet owners determine if the pavement is a safe temperature for their furry friends' paws.

## Features

*   **Advanced Temperature Model:** Calculates pavement temperature using a formula that incorporates air temperature, direct solar radiation, and wind speed for greater accuracy.
*   **Extended Hourly Forecast:** Displays an hour-by-hour forecast starting from the current time and extending up to 30 hours into the future. The current hour is highlighted for easy reference, and you can use "Show More" / "Show Less" buttons to expand or collapse the view.
*   **Interactive "Calculation Explorer":** Adjust the core weather values (air temp, solar radiation, wind speed) to see exactly how they impact the pavement temperature in real-time.
*   **Location-Based:** Check temperatures by searching for a city or using your device's current location.
*   **Clear Safety Indicators:** Color-coded messages show you at a glance if the pavement is safe, requires caution, or is dangerous.

## How to Use

1.  **Enter a location:** Type a city name or click "Use My Location".
2.  **Review the Forecast:** Check the current conditions and browse the hourly forecast. The table starts at the current hour. Use the "Show More" button to see further into the future.
