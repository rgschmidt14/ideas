# Xenophile

A game of skill creation and combination.

## Description

Xenophile is a tool that allows you to create skills and link them together in a skill tree. New skills are formed by combining two prerequisite skills or "faculties". The goal is to create a complex and interconnected web of abilities from a set of basic building blocks.

## Future Ideas

- [ ] Advanced graphical visualization of the skill tree.
- [ ] Ability to export/import skill trees.
- [ ] A "discovery" mode where you can only see skills you have the prerequisites for.
- [ ] More complex prerequisite rules (e.g., more than 2, OR conditions).
- [ ] Sharing skill trees with others.
